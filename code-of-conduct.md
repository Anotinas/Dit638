# Code of Conduct
### DIT638 Cyber Physical Systems and Systems of Systems

## Group 9
Members:
- Araz Farkosh
- Bence Ludmany
- David Lindgren
- Filip Fatic

### Collaboration plan
- We intend to have a minimum of four meetings every week where we will discuss how the project is progressing and what can be improved in our process.
    - Ideally every member should be present during these meetings but they are allowed to miss it if they have a valid excuse.
    - A valid excuse would entail health issues, family issues, transportation issues or trips abroad.
        - If a member’s situation is personal, they may choose not to disclose the reason.
    - If a member skips six meetings in a month, or three meetings in a row, a meeting will be called to discuss the issue.
- Each meeting will have an agenda.
    - This agenda will have a basic structure that most meetings will follow, but things may be added to each meeting’s agenda such as points about conflict resolution.
    - The agenda will also contain members present, as well as date, time, decisions made and artefacts worked on during the meeting.
	- Any decisions made during the meeting will be recorded in their own section in the agenda
	- Any work products produced or further developed will be recorded in their own section in the agenda
- `Trello` will be used to show what each team member is working on, what each team member has worked on, what should be achieved during each sprint and to show our total progress on the project. 
### Communication plan
- The two main tools which we will use to communicate aside from personal meetings will be `Slack` and `Discord`.
    - Discord has voice chat functionality which can be very useful incase a team member is incapable of being physically present during a meeting but still wants to participate. 
- Most of our communication will occur during the meetings or over slack while discord will be used to assist with meetings.  
- We will use a modified version of stand- up meetings by creating a `Slack` thread at *17:00 every day except Saturday*.
	- The reason Sunday is included so that members can have the liberty of working over the weekend and recapping over it in case they fell behind on work for that week.
    - All team members will then be expected to respond to said message with a description of what they have done that day to progress the project, difficulties they faced and plans for next day.
    - Content of all stand- up meetings will be stored in a separate document, sorted by date.
### Standard
- Avoid sexually or politically loaded aliases and conversations
- Keep unstructured criticism to a minimum
- Don’t insult or make personal attacks
- Don’t publish anyone’s personal information without permission
### Scope
- The code of conduct applies to project spaces, as well as places where a member represents the team or the product. Representation may include emails using the official student email address, public events and product demos.
- The code of conduct also applies to situations outside of the project space if team members agree that a person’s behaviour may negatively impact the perception of the team.
### Conflict resolution
- We believe there is merit in conflict and we view it as a means to improve our processes and our product. However we do not tolerate disrespectful behaviour or violation of the code of conduct.
- Conflicts during meetings
    - If a conflict between two individuals is identified in which the team can’t identify an obvious solution, a break will be called to go to the bathroom, get air/water/fika etc.
    - After the break, the parties involved will each get a space of 10 minutes to describe their viewpoint.
    - After each party has demonstrated the above, the discussion will be restarted until a satisfactory conclusion is reached.
- Conflicts outside of meetings
    - Each meeting will have a conflict resolution timeslot(if applicable) in which members will be allowed to discuss their disagreements.
    - Every point of conflict will be given a few minutes to discuss, and if it proves too difficult to resolve immediately, the strategy above will be implemented.
    - Conflicts outside of meetings will not be handled over text communication
- If the team deems the conversation to be too chaotic and/or uncontrolled, then one person will be given a `water bottle` and whoever holds that bottle will have the right to speak while all others need to listen.
    - All members may request the bottle at any point from the person holding it, but only the person holding the bottle decides when it will be released.
    - Ideally, the bottle will be distributed on a first come, first serve basis, but this is situational.
- If we are incapable of resolving an argument by ourselves then we will get the *TAs* and ask them for their opinion.
